The SSCS (Superstructure Class System) is a system for categorizing different Celestial and Terrestrial Structures by measure of size.
It was first envisioned in 2044 by astrophysicist [[Donald P. Schneider]] 

### SSCS Overview:
The SSCS uses a systematic naming convention, incorporating lettered tiers to classify the size and complexity of different structures. It will cover structures ranging from **quantum** and **atomic** particles to cosmic **megastellar** objects, **galactic superclusters**, and ultimately, universal constructs.

Letâ€™s organize this in a table format, where each class spans several orders of magnitude. This classification system will take into account **size**, **mass**, and **complexity** at different scales. The descriptions will indicate rough size ranges and examples for context.

### Key Classes:**

1. **A-Class (Atomic)**: The smallest scale in the SSCS, dealing with atomic particles like quarks, protons, neutrons, and basic atoms. This category also includes quantum particles, which form the foundation of matter. Though small in size, these particles are incredibly significant for their role in chemistry and physics.

2. **D-Class (Organismal)**: This scale includes living organisms, from bacteria to complex creatures like humans. It also incorporates robotics and AI entities capable of independent operation. These structures are typically meters in size, although they can vary widely.

3. **G-Class (Planetary)**: This tier defines planetary-sized structures like Earth and Mars, extending to life-sustaining or habitable planets, or artificially engineered planetary constructs. G-Class objects play a significant role in defining habitable zones for civilization and infrastructure.

4. **M-Class (Supergalactic)**: A major class within SSCS, representing vast networks of galaxies grouped into superclusters. M-Class objects, such as the **Virgo Supercluster**, represent a monumental scale of interconnected star systems and galaxies. They are vast enough to encapsulate smaller galactic formations and act as the defining bodies for large regions of the cosmos.

5. **O-Class (Universal)**: The largest conceivable scale in the SSCS. This category includes everything within the observable universe and beyond, encapsulating the full scope of cosmic structures from cosmic webs of dark matter to the very edge of the universe.

### Use Cases:
- **Intergalactic travel or construction**: The SSCS system is used to classify superstructures like Dyson Spheres, space elevators, or interstellar colonies.
